C++ API Reference
=================

There is a generated API documentation as a part of the ROS package documentation:

https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/p/ur_client_library/generated/index.html

It is generated directly from the source code using Doxygen. Though the documentation is hosted
inside the ROS documentation structure, it is not a ROS-specific API. The API is the same for all
platforms.
