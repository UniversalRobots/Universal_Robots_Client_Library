Usage examples
==============

This library contains a number of examples how this library can be used. You can use them as a
starting point for your own applications.

All examples take a robot's IP address as a first argument and some of them take a maximum run
duration (in seconds) as second argument. If the second argument is omitted, some of the examples
may be running forever until manually stopped.

.. note:: Most of these examples use the driver's headless mode. Therefore, on an e-Series (PolyScope 5) robot, the robot has to be
   in *remote control mode* to work.
