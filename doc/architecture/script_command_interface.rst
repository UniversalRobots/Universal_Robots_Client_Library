Script Command Interface
========================

The ``ScriptCommandInterface`` allows using functionality of the robot that would normally
interrupt program execution. For this purpose a subset of the robot's functionality is made
available in specific API calls.

At the time of writing the ``ScriptCommandInterface`` provides the following functions:

- ``zeroFTSensor()``: Zeros the force/torque sensor.
- ``setPayload()``: Set the active payload mass and center of gravity.
- ``setToolVoltage()``: Set the voltage of the tool output.
- ``startForceMode()`` / ``endForceMode()``: Start and end a force mode. See the `force mode
  example <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_Client_Library/blob/master/examples/force_mode_example.cpp>`_ for more information.
- ``startToolContact()`` / ``endToolContact()``: Start and end a tool contact mode. See the `tool
  contact example
  <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_Client_Library/blob/master/examples/tool_contact_example.cpp>`_
  for more information.

Communication protocol
----------------------

The ``ScriptCommandInterface`` communication is part of the protocol implemented in the
`external_control.urscript
<https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_Client_Library/blob/master/resources/external_control.urscript>`_.

Data sent to the robot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The robot reads from the "script_command_socket" expecting a 32 bit integer representation of up to
28 datafields.

.. note::
   In URScript the ``socket_read_binary_integer()`` function is used to read the data from the
   script command socket. The first index in that function's return value is the number of integers read,
   so the actual data starts at index 1. The indices in the table above are shifted by one when
   accessing the result array of the URScript function.

   All floating point data is encoded into an integer representation and has to be divided by the
   ``MULT_JOINTSTATE`` constant to get the actual floating point value. This constant is defined in
   ``ReverseInterface`` class.

Data sent from the robot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data is being sent from the robot to the ``ScriptCommandInterface`` only when tool contact is used.
It will send either ``UNTIL_TOOL_CONTACT_RESULT_SUCCESS`` when tool contact has been established while tool contact was active or ``UNTIL_TOOL_CONTACT_RESULT_CANCELED`` if tool contact mode was ended without establishing physical contact.
